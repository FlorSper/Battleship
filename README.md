# Battleship
Standard game of battleship

This game was made following a tutorial on CodeAcademy. It is still very incomplete though.
This game currently runs in IDLE and features a text-based grid.

*** TO DO ***
 - break down program into seperate functions. this should be first priority.
 - create a two-part ship - is currently only one intersect 
 - Want to add a two player mode.
 - add different types of missiles, add ability to move own ship's location.
 - build UI with tkinter.
 
*** Fixed ***
- game now ends after turns are exceeded
- game also now places guess exactly as represented on the grid
