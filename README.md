# Battleship
Standard game of battleship

This game was made following a tutorial on CodeAcademy. It is still very incomplete though.
This game currently runs in IDLE and features a text-based grid.

*** TO DO ***
 - Game does not end once the turn limit is exceeded, but DOES when guesses are correct. 
 - player's input is reflected on the playfield as an indexed number therefor when entering "1" the second row is actually selected.
 - break down program into seperate functions.
 - Want to add a two player mode.
